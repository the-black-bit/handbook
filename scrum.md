# Scrum

### Jeff Sutherland

SCRUM was a way of managing projects use to clear up the beurucratic mess of FBI.
Jeff was one of the important authors behind the agile manifesto.
Waterfall is named after Gant Charts which illusterate timeline.
Scrum is characterized by team building and constant feedback as reflected by the name
that comes from a moment in the Rugby game in which the team works together to move the
ball down the field.
Effective project managment is about promoting great teamwork. The manager can do four
things for that:
1. Let the team members decide how they are going to reach an objective. (NPR's
   award-winning report on the Arab spring in egypt)
2. Teams are more powerful and the sum of their staff. Set the team's expectation
   accordingly and make sure everyone's working towards the same common goal.
3. Create self-sufficient cross-functional teams that can complete a project without
   external help.
4. Reduce the size of the teams to 7Â±2, when we have to work too hard to figure out what
   everyone else is doing we slow down.

#### Sprints
Create a regular feedback system to keep your project on track.
Humans are bad at estimation. Scrum mitigates this with sprints. Sprints allow you to
recalibrate objectives on time. It also helps establishing a consistant rythm.

#### Daily
A friend of Jeff could finish remodelling his house in 6 weeks with daily meetings. The
neighbours - impressed with the result - hired the same team but it took them 3 months!
Daily standups that always occur at the same time and ask the same questions.
1. What did you do yesterday to help the team finish the sprint?
2. What do you plan to do today?
3. What obstacles are you facing?

The entire meeting should not last more than 15 minutes.

#### Avoid Waste
Avoid anything that distracts you from meeting your goals.
1. Focus on one thing at a time!
2. Use what you have created!
   General Motors experienced a great loss when it started its layoffs in 2012 because it
   had $7.5 billion in unsold trucks.
3. Fix immediately not later!
   Studies show that a bug you can resolve in 1 hour in the day in was *Observed* takes 24 
   hours to fix three weeks later because you don't remember all the factors that were
   involved.
5. Be reasonable!
   don't waste motivation with impossible goals that will burn the employees out.
4. Avoid Overworking and promote well-being and happiness!
   Study shows Judges make better decisions just after a break. Tired employees make more
   mistakes and create a lot of waste. People are not happy because they are successful!
   They are successful because they are happy.

#### Scrum Board
Visibility is the opposite of secrecy and creates trust and happiness.
Scrum board helps with that. Todo, In progress, In review, Done.

#### Sprint retrospective
Identify the Kaizen. Improvement after each sprint. 
1. How do you feel about your role in the company?
2. How do you feel about the company as a whole?
3. Why do you feel that way?
4. What one thing would make you happier in the next sprint?

Pay special attention to the last question and if possible apply the improvements
immediately to foster happiness and trust.

#### Prioritization
Product owner: Responsible for figuring out what to do when.
* Overall vision for the project
* Managing the backlog and setting the course for each sprint

The PO should posess three characteristics
* Market knowledge
* Enough authority to make decisions without interference from managers
* Availability to explain what needs to be done to team members
* Accountability for the final product or for how much revenue is produced

Toyota's Chief Engineers are reponsible for their own product line.

OODA Loop for making decisions based on feedback.
Observe: See where you are
Orient: Evaluate how to create more possibilities
Decide 
Act

Fighter pilots are trained to use this loop in their flights. (Identify danger, etc)

Scrum Master

#### How to implement Scrum in your office
1. Pick a PO

4. Create the project Backlog. 
   Move the task with the highest value and least risk to the top.
   Business Impact? Most important For customers? Make Most Money? Easiest to complete?
   Pay attention to what you can realistically achieve and what excites you.
   Prioritize what creates the most value and is easier to complete.
5. Make sure everything in the backlog is actually doable in a sprint.
6. Host the Scrum meeting and plan the first sprint.
