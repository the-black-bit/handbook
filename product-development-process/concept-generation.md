# Concept Generation
Description of product's technology, logic, and usage.
- (A set of customer needs, Target specifications) --> A set of product concepts
- Generate 100s of concepts, of which 5 to 20 will merit serious consideration.
- Inexpensive and quick (less than 5% budget, 15% time)
- Concept quality is a good predictor of product success.
- Common Dysfunctions in Concept Generation
  - Only considering few ideas
  - Neglecting Categories: Missing entire solution categories
  - Lack of External Insights: Ignoring other firms' concepts
  - Limited Team Involvement: Few people involved
  - Poor Integration: Leads to fragmented or incomplete product concepts

## Five-Step Concept Generation Method
1. Problem Decomposition
2. Search Externally
   - Gather ideas from outside sources: users, experts, patents, literature, benchmarking
3. Search Internally
   - Generate ideas within the team
4. Explore Systematically
   - Use classification trees and combination tables to organize and integrate ideas
5. Reflect on Solutions and Process
   - Review and provide constructive feedback

### 1. Problem Decomposition
- Purpose: Simplify complex problems into manageable parts
- Techniques:
  - Functional Decomposition: Breaking down by function
    - Overall Function: Represented as a black box with inputs and outputs
    - Subfunctions: Breakdown into specific tasks
    - Diagram Creation: Iterative drafting to refine function diagram
  - User Actions: Based on steps users take
  - Customer Needs: Focus on key needs

### 2: Search Externally
  - Continuous process throughout development.
  - Aims to find existing solutions for identified subproblems.
  - Saves time and cost by leveraging prior solutions.
  - Combines conventional and novel solutions for superior design.

Methods of External Search
  - Interview Lead Users
    - Early adopters with innovative solutions.
    - Valuable in b2b or techy areas like ad-agregator/ai.
    - Provide insights but may not generate new concepts.
  - Consult Experts: Often leads to direct solutions or fruitful areas.
  - Search Patents: A rich source of detailed technical information.
  - Search Published Literature: Journals, conferences, trade magazines.
  - Benchmark-Related Products: Reveals strengths and weaknesses of competitors.

### 3: Search Internally
- Using personal and team knowledge to brainstorm and generate solution concepts.
- Guidelines
  - Suspend judgment and criticism
  - Generate a large quantity of ideas
  - Ignore feasibility
  - Make plenty of sketches to visually explore concepts.
  - Build sketch models to better understand physical relationships and forms.
- Individual vs. Group Sessions
  - Individuals may excel at different dimensions of creativity (fluidity, flexibility, novelty).
  - Group sessions aid in building consensus, communication, and refining concepts.

Hints for Generating Solution Concepts
- Analogies: Use analogies from related fields or natural/biological systems.
- Wish and Wonder: Pose hypothetical scenarios to challenge existing boundaries.
- Distort Ideas: Modify or combine different solutions to create new concepts.
- Related and Unrelated Stimuli: Use stimuli from the problem context or random sources to inspire ideas. (For example put a plate of spaghetti on the table)
- Quantitative Goals: Set goals to motivate idea generation and maintain productivity. (We need 200 ideas)
- Gallery Method: Display and discuss multiple concepts simultaneously to foster creativity and collaboration.

### 4: Explore Systematically
- Now we have numerous concept fragments addressing subproblems.
- Systematic exploration involves organizing and synthesizing these fragments to navigate possibilities effectively.
- Considering all fragment combinations proves impractical due to complexity.
- Tools like the concept classification tree and concept combination table help manage complexity and guide thinking.
  
- Concept Classification Tree: Strcuture the solutions into a hierarchical tree.
  - Prune less promising branches.
  - Identify independent approaches.
  - Allocate resources into investigating different solutions top-down.
  
- Concept Combination Table
  - Enables systematic consideration of fragment combinations.
  - Each column represents a subproblem (e.g., energy TTS).
  - Facilitates forced associations among fragments to stimulate creative thinking.

### 5: Reflect on the Solutions and the Process
  - Reflection is crucial throughout the process to ensure thorough exploration.
  - Assessing confidence in exploring the solution space.
  - Considering alternative function diagrams and problem decompositions.
  - Evaluating thoroughness in utilizing external sources and integrating team ideas.
