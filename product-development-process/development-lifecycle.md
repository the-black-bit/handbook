Stage-Gate is a project management process that divides projects into stages, with each stage followed by a "gate." At these gates, senior management reviews the project's progress against set criteria, ensuring it aligns with strategic goals and is technically feasible before allowing it to proceed. This approach helps manage risks, allocate resources efficiently, and ensures that only viable projects move forward, allowing senior management to maintain oversight and guide key decisions.
