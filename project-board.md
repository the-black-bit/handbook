| Backlog        | Clear Desc, Priority  | Well-defined and Prioritized tasks for the next sprint      | Refine, break down into smaller tasks, change status to New at the begining of the sprint when they are assigned.                     |
| New            | Assignee, Estimate    | Tasks chosen for the current sprint.                        | Well-defined, clear scope, to be reviewed by the assignee, has initial estimate which will be reviewed by the assignee                |

| Blocking       | Notes                 | Tasks blocking other tasks                                  | Give more priority and collaborate to address and unblock the pending task                                                            |
| In Progress    | Deadline, Start       | Tasks actively being worked on                              | Provide updates, communicate challenges, seek help if needed to ensure smooth progression                                             |
| In Review      | Actual, PR            | Completed tasks under quality assurance                     | Conduct thorough reviews, address feedback, ensure tasks meet acceptance criteria before marking as "Done"                            |

| Failed*        | Actual                | Unsuccessful tasks                                          | Conduct retrospective, analyze reasons for failure, identify lessons learned, take corrective actions to prevent similar failures     |

Note: Failed status does not indicate individual failure. Instead, it highlights potential
issues in planning, team organization, or changes in priorities.

Purpose of Failed Status:
* Track overall planning quality over the long run to identify systematic issues.
* Discussing them in the sprint retrospective meetings can help teams improve their
  planning process and capacity management iteratively.

Again! The failed status simply indicates that the task was not completed within the
planned time frame. **It is not** a judgment on the person assigned to the task.

### Additional Guidelines:
- Updating Task Deadlines: Whenever a task's deadline is changed, ensure that a comment is added under the task explaining the reason for the change and indicating the initial deadline value.
- Communication: Maintain active communication within the team regarding task statuses, progress updates, and any impediments faced to facilitate collaboration and alignment.

By adhering to these defined task statuses and processes, the Scrum team can effectively manage their work items, monitor progress, and proactively address any issues or challenges that may arise during the sprint cycle. üõ†Ô∏èüöÄ
