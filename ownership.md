Imagine facing a looming deadline and seeking clarification by tagging a colleague in
Figma or Slack, hoping for timely insights. However, due to unforeseen circumstances such
as busyness or absence, your query goes unanswered, leading to delays. Blaming task
ambiguity on the lack of response post-deadline is unacceptable. As a proactive team
member, it's crucial to take initiative in resolving ambiguities promptly, using any means
necessaryâ€”whether by phone, in-person discussion, or involving others for assistance.
While this may initially cause inconvenience, addressing such challenges can later prompt
a retrospective meeting to refine processes. However, prioritizing timely task completion
remains paramount over procedural adjustments.

It is like the old times when poeple called after sending an SMS to make sure it arrived!
