# Shared Vocabulary among Commit-m people

## Tech

### Common

1. **IDE** (Integrated Development Environment): Just as writers use words for writing. Developers use different IDEs for writing code. VSCode is one of the most popular ones.
1. **Git**: A version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
1. **Design Pattern**: A commonly used and proven way of solving a design or coding problem. The best practices of design. For example, placing the bathroom next to the front door is a design pattern in architecture.
1. **Debug**: To find and fix problems or errors in computer programs or machines. It's like troubleshooting to make things work correctly.
1. **Technical Debt**: When developers take shortcuts to deliver something faster, they accumulate "technical debt". Over time, this can make the software more complex and harder to maintain and we should do refactoring and rewriting once in a while to pay off this debt and clean things up.
1. **Refactor**: To improve or reorganize code in a software program to make it cleaner, more efficient, or easier to understand.
1. **Rewrite**: Happens when the old code is barely usable and maintainable, or needs a wide and major change.
1. **Schema**: A document that defines the structure and organization of a database, data, or API.
1. **SDK** (Software Development Kit): A set of tools and libraries developers use to create applications for specific platforms.
1. **Unit Testing**: Testing individual software components or functions in isolation to ensure they operate as intended.
1. **Cache**: A temporary storage location that stores frequently accessed data to reduce the need to access the source.

### Frontend

1. **Frontend**: The part of a website or software that interacts with the user, often called the "client-side."
1. **Component**: A part of a bigger system, a building block. For example, a specific button in an app is a component that we define once and use everywhere.
1. **Mocking**: Creating a pretend or imitation version of something for testing or practice, like using a fake version of a program to test it.

### Backend

1. **Access Tokens**: Special things like passwords. If someone has it they can access certain things.
1. **Backend**: The part of a website or software that is not visible to the user, often referred to as the "server side."
1. **Swagger**: A tool for documenting and testing APIs (ways for software to communicate with each other) in an easy-to-understand format.
1. **Microservices**: A software development technique in which one large software is divided into several smaller microservices that interact with each other and each one is responsible for a specific type of task.
1. **Redis**: A fast temporary datastore used to store and retrieve data, often used for caching. Things are not stored in it permanently and we don't rely on it. The real things are stored in the actual database.
1. **Nest**: The framework we use for the backend of the projects written in nodejs.

### API

1. **API** (Application Programming Interface): A set of rules and protocols that allow one software application to communicate with another.
1. **Endpoint**: The URL (or URI) where a client application can access an API or web service.
1. **Postman**: A tool that helps test and manage web services by sending requests and receiving responses. We use it to test the backend APIs to make sure the front end can use them easily and they work as expected.
1. **Status Code**: A code that tells you whether a request to a website or server was successful or not. For example, 404 means "page not found." 500 means the server is broken.

### Database

1. **Database Design**: Planning how to structure and organize data in a database, like deciding how to store information in a digital filing system.
1. **Query**: A request for information or data from a database or search engine, like asking a question to find specific information.
1. **CRUD**: An abbreviation for Create, Read, Update, Delete, which are basic operations used in managing data in a database.
1. **Generating Data**: Filling the database of the app with some data so that the app will not be empty. For example, defining some users and videos and putting pictures, etc.
1. **SQL** (Structured Query Language): A language with which you can speak to relational databases that store data in tables.
1. **NoSQL**: A type of database that doesn't use tables for storing the data like relational databases do.

### Infrastructure

1. **Docker**: A set of platform-as-a-service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.
1. **Kubernetes**: An open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers.
1. **Scalability**: The capability of a system to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.
1. **DevOps**: A set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to make sure everything stays up and running so the users can use it. It is related to maintaining the infrastructure on which the codes are run.
1. **CI/CD** (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment): A tool for automatically deploying the codes that are merged into production so that they can be tested and published for customers.
1. **Firewall**: A network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
1. **Jenkins**: A tool for automating tasks in software development. For example, when a code is reviewed and merged, Jenkins will automatically deploy it to the server.
1. **SSL** (Secure Sockets Layer): A standard security protocol for establishing encrypted links between a web server and a browser in an online communication. SSL is the difference between http and https.

### Testing

1. **A/B testing**: We want to see if changing the color of a button to red will make users click more on it so we make it red and see if the clicks increase but many times we implement multiple features at the same time and some promotions happen too and also time is changing so the rate of clicks might be due to other reasons so what we do is that for half of the users randomly and see how many times they click on that button and compare it with how many times the other users click on that button.
